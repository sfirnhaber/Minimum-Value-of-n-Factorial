# Minimum-Value-of-n-Factorial
For the function (n!) and time t, determine the largest size n of a problem that can be solved in time t, assuming that the algorithm to solve theproblem takes (n!) microseconds. 
I was given this problem for homework, and I needed to whip up some quick code to solve it.
